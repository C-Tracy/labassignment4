I currently manage my documents and code by storing them on dropbox. I add as many comments as possible to help myself when re-running code in the future, however I haven't yet had a paper where I make the code available via github as I haven't been familiar enough with using github.

After this portion of the course and this lab, I feel much more comfortable and compelled to use github and make my code accessible. I think that comp bio and bioinformatics is hindered by non-reproducible code because it doesn't allow people to learn from code availabe, or to verify that the code was used properly. In phylogenetics there are a lot of packages where people put the parameters used in their methods, but as you get away from using pre-made packages and creating your own code it is more imperative to make this open source.
